# StarNet

StarNet is an AI model that were build to predict information about stars. Information such as startype, star color and star spectral class is predicted in this model, making this a useful tool for astronomers to quickly gain information about a star that is being observed. This project were a Final year project done at gymnasium (High School) SSIS (Stockholm Sciense Innovation School)

## Overview

The starnet program, consisting of a website and a server with the trained model, makes it easier to research stars. 
Enter following information that is gathered:
- Temperature
- Luminosity
- radius

The model now predicts following star attributes:
- Star Type
- Star Color
- Star spectral class

## Repository structure

The repository is devided into two parts:
- AI model, consisting of the trained model and machine learning code. Programmed in python
- App Frontend, the user interface for the program. Created with vite with typescript.
