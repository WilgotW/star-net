# StarNet

StarNet is an AI model that were build to predict information about stars. Information such as startype, luminosity, size, class and more is predicted in this model, making this a useful tool for astronomers to quickly gain information about a star that is being observed. This project were a Final year project done at gymnasium (High School) SSIS (Stockholm Sciense Innovation School)

## Overview

The starnet program, consisting of a website and a server containing the trained model, makes it easier to research stars. 
Enter following information that is gathered:
- Temperature
- Luminosity
- radius

The model now predicts following star attributes:
- Star Type
- Star Color
- Star spectral class

## Repository structure

The repository is devided into two parts:
- AI model, consisting of the trained model and machine learning code. Programmed in python
- App Frontend, the user interface for the program. Created with vite with typescript.

## Images

Some images taken from the program.
